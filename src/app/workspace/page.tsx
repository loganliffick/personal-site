            <h2>Third space</h2>
            <p>
              I've been obsessed with creating the perfect sanctuary since the
              world went remote. A space that works for how I work where I can
              create without distraction from the outside world.
            </p>
            <p>
              It started with a standing desk, crafted from a slab of butcher's
              block and a Fully Jarvis frame, a sleek fusion of mechanical
              precision and organic warmth. Serving as the studio's focal point,
              the desk sets the tone for the entire space: light wood tones,
              matte black accents, and inviting, cozy furnishings.
            </p>
            <p>
              As with all hobbies, I began pouring more and more time into the
              space rearranging furniture, experimenting with accent pieces, and
              picking up new additions along the way. Most importantly, I
              finally tackled some much needed cord management.

            <p>
              As a taller person, I've been a fan of third party monitor arms
              for as long as I can remember. In the past, I've opted for sturdy
              pole-arm mounts for their simplicity and price-point, but more
              recently found myself hunting for a more premium product.
            </p>
            <p>Enter the Fully Jarvis arm.</p>
            <p>
              The desk itself is a Fully Jarvis and I trust their products â€”no
              matter who's selling them, so I kept it in the family and
              purchased their monitor arm after some scrupulous research. Many
              thanks to{' '}

              Additionally, I added backdrop lighting with a few pieces from the
              Philips Hue collection to help ease eye strain and give the room a
              little ambiance.

              On the less-technical side, I picked up a Studio Neat Mark One pen
              and a few Baron Fig notebooks.
